# Note-GitHub-API

This upload is in response to a requested assessment.

I combined the notes backend API and the GitHub Issues frontend task into one project. 

The view that is displayed on project startup is the requested GitHub issues frontend.

While the local server is running you should be able to query the notes API via your curl (or I used postman, a chrome extension).

Cheers!
